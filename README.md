<h3>Four Steps to Glory</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Add the styles from <em>like-styles.css</em> to your theme's main stylesheet.</li>
  <li>Add <em>post-like.js</em> to your theme's <em>js</em> folder (if it exists). If there is no <em>js</em> folder, create one and add <em>post-like.js</em> to it.</li>
  <li>Add the contents of post-like.php to your theme's functions.php file.</li>
  <li>Add and echo the button function to your theme's single page template (typically content-single.php).</li>
</ol>
